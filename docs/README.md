# Weave Developer Guide

Welcome to Weave’s developer docs. This guide covers installing the library, building screens, composing components, styling and theming, using effects and animations, and extending Weave with your own components, effects, and properties.

How to use this guide
- Read from top to bottom on your first pass; each page ends with a Next Step link so you can follow a sensible path from setup → basics → visuals → dynamics → extension points.
- Skim the Quick links if you just need a specific topic; you can jump in anywhere and come back later.

- Getting started: installation, Gradle setup, init
- Building GUIs: screens, components, layouts, constraints
- Visuals: stylesheets, themes, variables, parts, states
- Dynamics: effects, animations, transitions, easings
- Extensibility: new components, effects, properties, builders
