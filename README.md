# Weave

**Weave** is a declarative, component-based UI library for Minecraft.
It helps you build clean, responsive, and themeable GUIs that are easy to compose, extend, and ship in your mods.

---

## Declarative UI

With Weave, you **describe what the UI should look like** and how it behaves based on state â€” not how to draw it step by step.

- Compose a **tree of components** (layouts, panels, buttons, text, images, etc.).
- Attach **styles and effects** through a stylesheet-like system with typed properties.
- Bind visuals and layout to **observable state**; when state changes, the UI updates automatically.
- Define **transitions and easing** for smooth, automatic style changes instead of imperative animations.

This makes UI code predictable and modular:
**state flows in â†’ components render from state â†’ Weave handles layout, rendering, input, and transitions.**

---

## Design & Philosophy

- **Composable** â€“ Everything is a component or state you can combine and reuse.
- **Pluggable** â€“ Register custom components, animations, and style properties.
- **Non-intrusive** â€“ Extend via public APIs â€” no forking or editing core required.
- **Customizable** â€“ Override visuals and interactions via stylesheets, themes, or custom renderers.
- **Future-proof** â€“ Clear separation of concerns (Component Tree, Layout, Stylesheet, Animator) ensures stability as the core evolves.

## ðŸš€ Installation

Weave is designed to be **vendored directly** into your mod repository.

```
your-repo/
  weave/        # Weave source and resources (this library)
  my-mod/       # Your mod
```

1. **Add Weave sources and resources**
   Copy `src/client/java/tytoo/weave/**` and `src/client/resources/**` into `weave/src/client/...`.

2. **Wire mixins**
   Add the Weave client mixin config to your modâ€™s `fabric.mod.json` to bridge input/render events.

3. **Initialize Weave**
   In your client entrypoint:

   ```java
   import net.fabricmc.api.ClientModInitializer;
   import tytoo.weave.WeaveCore;

   public final class MyModClient implements ClientModInitializer {
       @Override
       public void onInitializeClient() {
           WeaveCore.init();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Run in dev**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew runClient
   ```
   In-game, run `/weave testgui` to open the demo screen.
